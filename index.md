# JParticles Tutorial


## Introduction
JParticles  is java library to simulate the evolution of particles systems (see next section). You will need JRE1.8 (or higher) installed on your machine to run the programs in this tutorial.

## Particle Systems


A particle system is a collection of point masses whose motions obey Newton's second law of motion, i.e the acceleration of a given particle is equal to the force on that particle divided by its mass. In the JParticles, a particle system is represented as an object of the class ParticleSystem. For example, if we want to construct a system of ten particles in two-dimensional space, we use the code:

´´´
particles = new ParticleSystem(2,10);
´´´









You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/valerocar/JParticles/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/valerocar/JParticles/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
